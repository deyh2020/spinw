### SpinW Matlab Library can do the following things: ###

  * create crystal structures

  * create magnetic structures

  * create magnetic Hamiltonian with single ion anisotropy, exchange interactions and external magnetic field

  * calculate spin-spin correlation function

  * plotting crystal structures, magnetic structures and interactions

  * optimize magnetic structures based on the classical energy
